# cartesian-to-polar
Program to convert complex numbers from cartesian form to polar form in TI-Basic

## How to use
I recommend to just look at the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffrypig23/cartesian-to-polar/master/cartpol.bas), and then just copy it into your calculator. That way, your still doing the work, and you might learn a thing or two about how to program on a graphing calculator :P

This will mostl likely have to be done manually, as im sure the exact syntax I used in the `.bas` file is not correct, but it should get the point across ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
